# Operator Toolkit

Operator Toolkit is a framework and collection of helpers designed to facilitate the development of Kubernetes
operators. With the goal of promoting code homogeneity across different operators, the toolkit offers a comprehensive
set of tools and best practices. By leveraging Operator Toolkit, you can streamline the construction of Kubernetes operators and ensure consistent coding
patterns and practices across your projects.

For detailed documentation, guides, and examples, please refer to the
[project wiki](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/operator-toolkit/wiki). The wiki serves as a
central resource for comprehensive information on the toolkit's various components and features. It provides detailed
explanations, code samples, and best practices that will help you effectively utilize the toolkit to construct
high-quality Kubernetes operators.

Key Features of Operator Toolkit:
- Abstractions for defining controllers, and reconcilers.
- Predicates for filtering and handling resource updates.
- Utilities for managing conditions, metrics, and event filtering.
- Seamless integration with [Operator SDK](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/) and [controller-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime).
- Extensive documentation and examples.
